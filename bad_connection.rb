# Write a program which can imitate a Customer Service Representative whose
# phone connection is bad with these rules:

# If you donâ€™t input anything (just hit enter) they respond with HELLO?!
# If you ask a question with any lower-case letters, they respond with I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU.
# If you ask a question in all upper-case letters, they respond with NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE
# The first time you say GOODBYE! they say ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?
# The second time you say GOODBYE! they say THANK YOU FOR CALLING! and the program exits.
# To run the program, you would enter in your command line: ruby bad_connection.rb
